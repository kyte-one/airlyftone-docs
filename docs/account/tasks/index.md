# Tasks

Airlyft enables you to create innovative marketing campaigns that can interact with most social platforms, including Twitter, Telegram, Discord, YouTube, and Instagram. We also have integrations with The Gragh, Subquery, and Subsquid for verifying user on-chain actions. Most EVM-based on-chain actions can be verified using our Smart Contract task, which requires only a few clicks to set up.
