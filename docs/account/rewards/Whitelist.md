# Whitelist/Shortlist Reward
AirLyft now supports Whitelist Campaigns as well. Create your campaigns in simple steps and shortlist your campaign winners as per your criteria. Please follow the steps below on how to conduct a Whitelist Reward Giveaway.

## What is a whitelist/shortlist?
A "whitelist" or a "shortlist" means that you (the event host) will get a list of winners from the event and you can use that list in any way you please.
## When to use a whitelist/shortlist?
Usually, a whitelist/shortlist reward is used for instances where you cannot use AirLyft to distribute the reward. For example:
- You are launching an NFT project and want to capture early community members or supporters.
- The reward is some merchandise that you will manually send to the winners.
- You want to create an event for a beta product access, discount, pre-launch offers etc.

## How to create a whitelist?
1. Fill out all your event details on the first page then move onto the task selection page.
