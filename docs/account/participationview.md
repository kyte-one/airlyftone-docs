# Participant List View

AirLyft provides projects the flexibility to view participants entries at any point during the event. You can check on a overall scale the number of the entries a particular user has scored, the number of tasks they have completed, and also check on what actions have they performed as a part of this event. Let's take a deep look at where can we view the participant list. 

- Login to AirLyft and once you are on the dashboard, please click on events tab as shown in the screenshot below.

- The current view provides a overall view of users who have participated from multiple sources such as Email, Metamask, Twitter, Telegram etc. You can also view what are the entries a particular user has been rewarded and how many tasks have they completed.
