# NFT FAQs

### What is an NFT?

Digital assets known as NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are distinct and cannot be reproduced or replaced. As these are distinctive assets, they can also be referred to as the decentralised evidence of ownership or proof of validity that is stored on the blockchain. The NFTs can be in the form of digital art, audio, game items, collectibles or video and can only be transferred or traded to a different owner on the blockchain. 


### What is a Commemorative NFT that we are distributing?

AirLyft is pleased to be an NFT partner at the BITSAA BGM event. You can think of the Commemorative NFTs as digital badges or memorabilia that only the attendees of this event can claim. These NFTs represent the proof of your attendance of this event on the Binance or BNB Blockchain.
 
### Where and how are NFTs stored?

These NFTs are not stored in any cloud servers, or centralised systems, instead they are deployed on the blockchain around the world to different nodes. In a broader sense, NFTs consist of 2 parts which are the smart contract (or the code) and the digital asset (image, audio, videos, collectibles etc.). The code is deployed on the blockchain and the asset stored on IPFS or InterPlanetary File System.

### How do you access your NFT?

NFTs can easily be listed on famous available NFT marketplaces such as Opensea, Rarible, Joepegs and others. You can easily check for your collection by logging into these websites and searching for your NFT. Being said that, you can also import your NFT to any decentralized wallet to view them directly in your wallets. Here is a link on how to [import your NFTs.](https://intercom.help/swappable/en/articles/5603343-how-do-i-see-an-nft-in-my-metamask-wallet)


### Canâ€™t I just right click / screenshot & save the NFT? 

So think of a painting that you painted. Now, someone can click a photograph and get a print out, however, the painting is still yours and you are the owner. In the same way, as we mentioned above, the metadata of NFTs are stored on the blockchain using the smart contract code which validates your authenticity or proof of ownership to a particular digital asset. You can clearly view the entire history of NFT i.e. from its point of origin to its trade history and who is the current owner.
