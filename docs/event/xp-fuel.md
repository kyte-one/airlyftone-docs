# XP & Fuel

For every quest that a user completed on AirLyft, they are rewarded with some XP as well as some Fuel. Here is how they both differ:

# What is XP

XP denotes Experience Points that you have earned. XP determines:

1. The Level of a participant in a community
2. The position of the user in the leaderboard
3. The rank a user receives in a Ranked Random Raffle (Only the XP earned within a campaign)

# What is Fuel

Fuel can be governed by project hosts and will eventually be 'burnable', which means participants will be able to spend their collected Fuel to claim other kinds of Rewards in case the community host sets up items in the Shop.
