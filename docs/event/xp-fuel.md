# XP & Fuel

For every quest that a user completed on AirLyft, they are rewarded with some XP as well as some Fuel. Here is how they both differ:

# What is XP

XP, or experience points, are governed by the system itself and cannot be modified by a project host. The XP governs:

1. The Level of a user in a community
2. The position of the user in the leaderboard

# What is Fuel

Fuel can be governed by project hosts and will eventually be 'burnable', which means participants will be able to spend their collected Fuel to claim other kinds of Rewards in the Shop.
