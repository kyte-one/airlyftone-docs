# Ranked Random Raffle

This is an automatic winner selection strategy that means that the winners will be chosen without any intervention from the community host.

The ranked random strategy works as following:
1. Sort all participants as per the amount of Fuel they have scored in the particular campaign
2. Select winners from top to bottom
3. If the no. of people who have scored the same fuel are greater than number of winners left to select, then Randomly select the remaining winners.

- **Fuel Scoring:** 
    - 20 fuel is the max fuel that can be scored.
    - 100 Participants scored 20 Fuel
    - Others scored different numbers but less than 20 Fuel
