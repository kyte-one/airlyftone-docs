# Dotsama & EVM Wallet Tasks

Certain projects prefer manual distribution of rewards, or wants to distribute rewards later once your tokens/NFT go live. We understand that how difficult is it for the marketing an community team to manually collect these address on any chain and with that in mind, projects can create Wallet tasks at AirLyft in which participants during the time of event can collect wallet addresses of participant through MetaMask, Wallet Connect & more. Let's take a look at how to set up Wallet Tasks at AirLyft.

- Login to AirLyft and create an event. On the event page, click on select Apps tab where you can find the Wallet block.
