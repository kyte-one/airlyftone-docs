- Next, if you don't see your tokens available on the list, you can find the [Request Asset Whitelist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmdE3BmNwWQ1kZbKZqFzzRoBX38ltecXiSjuS5VEthwH28Yw/viewform) option. Click on it and fill up the short form for us to manually add the tokens to the asset list. 

- Once you fill up the pool details, next you will be asked to connect your Metamask, or any EVM supported wallet to sign the transaction, and approve locking of mentioned Amount into the pool.
