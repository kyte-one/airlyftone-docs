We have very strategically placed the above parameters in a single view as it gives a greater picture of your campaign performance. Some of the insights you can receive are

- How many users have viewed your event but may or may not have participated i.e. VIEWS
- How many users have participated in your event i.e. PARTICIPANTS
- Based on views and participants, what are overall conversion rate of users landing on your campaign i.e CONVERSION
- With number of tasks available, what percentage of users have viewed and what percentage of users have participated to complete a specific task i.e. TASK LEVEL CONVERSION

These parameters we understand are very important when you conclude the performance of the campaign and based on the numbers achieved, you can strategically design your future campaign in a way that can provide a greater conversion rates.
