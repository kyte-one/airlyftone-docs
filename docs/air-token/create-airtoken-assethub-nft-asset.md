# Create AssetHub NFT / Asset

This article focuses on how to create your AssetHub NFT / Asset on AirLyft.

## What are AssetHub NFT and AssetHub Assets?

Asset Hub is a specialized parachain on the Polkadot network that provides functionality for deploying and transferring assets, including both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

### AssetHub NFTs

NFTs on the Asset Hub are a type of digital asset where each token is unique, meaning the particular instance of a non-fungible asset (NFT) has a separate meaning from another instance of the same class. Click [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-assets#non-fungible-assets) to learn more about AssetHub NFTs.

### AssetHub Assets

These are assets that are managed and facilitated by the Asset Hub, a specialized parachain on Polkadot designed for handling and managing digital assets across various applications. Assets in the Asset Hub can be represented on several chains and can take many forms, from a parachain's native token to on-chain representations of off-chain reserves.
