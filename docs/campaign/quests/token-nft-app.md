# Token / NFT App

The Token / NFT App module allows you to check whether a user holds a specified amount of a token or a certain quantity of an NFT in their wallet. This can be used to verify if a user meets certain criteria, such as being an early supporter, by checking if they hold a specific token. In this module, we will be discussing below actions:

- [Hold a Token](#hold-a-token)
- [Hold NFT (ERC721)](#hold-nft-erc721)

Creating these actions are very simple and straight forward at AirLyft.

- On the event page, click on Quests tab where you can find the 'Token / NFT App' block.
