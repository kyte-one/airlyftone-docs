# Kickstarter

Kickstarter tasks help you drive awareness and engagement for your crowdfunding campaign. This task type encourages participants to watch your project video and visit your Kickstarter project page, helping increase visibility and potential backing for your campaign. It's an effective way to leverage your community to boost your Kickstarter project's reach and engagement.

- On the event page, click on Quests tab where you can find the **Kickstarter** block.
