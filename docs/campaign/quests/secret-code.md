# Secret Code

The Secret Code task allows organizers to create engagement by hiding secret codes in various locations and challenging participants to find and enter them. This gamification element encourages deeper interaction with your content, social channels, or community spaces. Organizers can add one or more secret codes, making it flexible for multi-stage campaigns or different difficulty levels.

- On the event page, click on Quests tab where you can find the **Secret Code** block.

- To configure the **Task Condition & Recurrence**, refer to the [Task Condition & Recurrence](../task-condition-and-recurrence.md) page.

- Next, add your secret codes by typin them in the secret code input field. You can add multiple codes to increase engagement opportunities.

> For each secret code, enter the exact code that participants will need to input. Make sure the codes are memorable but not too obvious.
