### Tweet Specific Content on Twitter

Most of the times, projects wants user to post a specific content on Twitter pertaining to a certain release or upcoming events. For instance, let's suppose that a project XYZ is about to release a staking functionality in the month of January '23 and as a part of tasks.

Hence, if projects wants users to post a specific content, they can use the Tweet Specific content functionality on AirLyft and the platform will validate if this particular specific content by posted by the participants or not. Please follow steps below on creating a Tweet Specific content task.

- Moving forward, select the type of Tweet i.e. New Tweet, Quote Tweet, Reply. It means that, you are giving users the direction to reply a specific content in form of a New Tweet, or QT, or a simple reply.

- Now, say in certain cases, if you dont want users to write anything and just add Hashtags or mention Specific users, in that case, just enter the required Hashtag and users as shown in screenshot below. You can also specify the number of friends to tag, and number of media attachments to include in the Tweet being sent out.

- You can also select the type of verification you want for the task. You can learn more about the available verification options by reading the [Verification Types](../quest-verification-type.md) guide.

### Allow Only Specific Accounts On Twitter

The Allow Only Specific Accounts on Twitter feature enables projects to restrict task participation to a predefined list of Twitter handles. This ensures that only whitelisted users can verify and complete the quest. AirLyft automatically cross-checks participants against the whitelist and approves only those included.

For example, suppose Project XYZ is launching a new staking feature in February 2025 and wants only its early adopters to share feedback on what tokens they'd like to see on the platform. By using the whitelist functionality, the project can ensure that only these selected participants can engage in the campaign. Let's go through the process of setting up this task.

- To begin, head over to the Twitter option in AirLyft and select the Whitelist option, as shown in the screenshot below.

- At the first step, configure the basic details for your whitelisted task. For detailed instructions on setting up basic details, refer to the [Quest Basic Details](../quest-basic-details.md) guide.
