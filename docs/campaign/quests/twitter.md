> **Hey!!! A new staking functionality will be live on XYZ App by January '23. #XYZ #Staking**

#### Allow Only Specific Accounts On Twitter

The Allow Only Specific Accounts on Twitter feature enables projects to restrict task participation to a predefined list of Twitter handles. This ensures that only whitelisted users can verify and complete the quest. AirLyft automatically cross-checks participants against the whitelist and approves only those included.

For example, suppose Project XYZ is launching a new staking feature in February 2025 and wants only its early adopters to share feedback on what tokens they'd like to see on the platform. By using the whitelist functionality, the project can ensure that only these selected participants can engage in the campaign. Let's go through the process of setting up this task.

- To begin, head over to the Twitter option in AirLyft and select the Whitelist option, as shown in the screenshot below.

  ![](../../images/TwitterOptions.png)

- At the first step, enter the Basic Information for the whitelisted task. This includes a title and description. It is recommended to provide a detailed description so that participants have a clear understanding of the task and its requirements.

#### User Generated Content on Twitter

As the name suggests, user generated content can specifically be used by the projects to create tasks where they can opt users to enter their own suggestions about a certain activity. Unlike Tweet Specific Content functionality where users have to post only the content shared by project, in UGC tasks, users write their original content and share it as submissions.

For instance, let's suppose that a project XYZ is about to release a staking functionality in the month of February '25 and as a part of campaign, the project wants all its participants to tweet their feedback about what tokens do they want to see in their Staking Platform. At AirLyft, you can create such tasks very easily using the User Generated Content functionality. Let's dive deep into how can we create this task.

If you want users to Tweet with just text, toggle the "Tweet must contain text" to On. And, if you want users to add ../images too, toggle the " Tweet must contain ../images" to On.

Based on option selection, just enter the URL of tweet on which users will be perfomring a quote tweet or reply.
