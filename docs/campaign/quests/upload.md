AirLyft's **AI Agentic Verification** enables projects to automate the verification of User Generated Content (UGC) submissions. This powerful feature helps ensure content authenticity and saves 100+ hours for marketing and community teams.

## üß† What is AI-Powered Verification?

Instead of manually checking every UGC submission, you can configure AI-powered rules to **automatically verify** the content and award points only when it meets the campaign criteria. This prevents irrelevant or fake submissions (like blank screenshots or gibberish text) from being accepted.
