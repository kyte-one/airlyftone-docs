# Checkin

The Checkin module adds a simple checkin task to the campaign. Users visit the campaign link daily and click the 'checkin' button. This awards them with cFuel and XP, encouraging daily visits and increasing campaign views.

- On the event page, click on Quests tab where you can find the **Checkin** block.
