# Blog

Blog tasks enable you to drive engagement with your written content and encourage community participation in content creation. Whether you want participants to engage with existing blog posts through comments or create original content by writing their own blogs, these tasks help build a more engaged and content-rich community. In this module, we will be discussing the following Blog actions:

- [Blog Comment](#blog-comment)
- [Blog Write](#blog-write)

These actions provide flexibility in how you want your community to interact with blog content, supporting both engagement and content creation goals.

- On the event page, click on Quests tab where you can find the **Blog** block.
