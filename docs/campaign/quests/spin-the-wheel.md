# Spin the Wheel

The **Spin the Wheel** task allows projects to reward participants with **cFuel** or **XP** through a randomized spin-the-wheel mechanism. This feature is ideal for gamified engagement, where users have a chance to win different reward amounts based on predefined probabilities.

- Next, expand 'Task Condition and Recurrence' option to set the task frequency and task conditions.

  - 'Task Frequency' determines how often users can complete a task. There are four options:

    - **None:** The task can only be completed once.
    - **Daily:** The task resets daily at midnight.
    - **Weekly:** The task resets at the start of every week.
    - **Monthly:** The task resets at the start of every month.

  - 'Task Conditions' determines if a user can perform a task or not. There are four options:
    - **Task Completed:** It only allows a user to perform a task if he has either completed or not completed another task.
    - **Date:** It only allows user to perform a task before or after the set date.
    - **Max Participants:** The task is locked after a certain number of users have completed it.

- Now, choose the **reward type**, either **cFuel** or **XP**, based on what you want participants to receive.

- Once selected, enter the **reward amounts** and their respective **winning probabilities**. This setup ensures that different rewards have different chances of being won, creating an exciting and dynamic experience for participants.

- Finally, click **Add Task** to activate the Spin the Wheel task.
