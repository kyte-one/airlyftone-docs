# Spin the Wheel

The **Spin the Wheel** task allows projects to reward participants with **cFuel** or **XP** through a randomized spin-the-wheel mechanism. This feature is ideal for gamified engagement, where users have a chance to win different reward amounts based on predefined probabilities.

- Login to AirLyft and create a campaign. On the campaign page, click on Quests tab where you can find the Spin the Wheel block.

- Now, choose the **reward type**, either **cFuel** or **XP**, based on what you want participants to receive.

- Once selected, enter the **reward amounts** and their respective **winning probabilities**. For example:

  - You can set up different reward tiers like:
    - 100 cFuel with 10% probability (rare reward)
    - 50 cFuel with 30% probability (uncommon reward)
    - 20 cFuel with 60% probability (common reward)

  The probabilities must add up to 100%. This setup ensures that different rewards have different chances of being won, creating an exciting and dynamic experience for participants. In the example above, when a user spins the wheel, they have a 60% chance to win 20 cFuel, a 30% chance to win 50 cFuel, and a 10% chance to win 100 cFuel.

- Finally, click **Add Task** to activate the Spin the Wheel task.
