# Token Giveaway (ERC20)

## What are ERC20 Tokens?

ERC20 tokens are standardized, fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Companies can create these tokens and distribute them to campaign participants as rewards.

## When to use ERC20 Tokens?

Use ERC20 tokens when you want to:

- Reward participants with a divisible, tradable asset.
- Create a loyalty or points system for your community.
- Distribute your company's own cryptocurrency or utility token.

## How to create an ERC20 Token reward?

1. In the campaign creation process, navigate to the 'Rewards' section and select "Token Giveaway (ERC20)" as your reward type. Then, choose between [AirToken](../../../air-token) and [AirPool](../../../air-pool).

## Winner Selection Strategies
1. **[FCFS](../winner-selection/fcfs):** In this, you can set conditions based on the amount of fuel secured or the number of tasks completed (e.g., “Number of Tasks > X”).

3. **[Manual selection at the end of the campaign](../winner-selection/manual):** If you select this then you will have the option to manually select winners from the participants after the campaign ends.
4. **[Ranked Random Raffle at the end of the campaign](../winner-selection/ranked-random):** In this, AirLyft will automatically select winners in a random way (but selecting those with higher points first).
