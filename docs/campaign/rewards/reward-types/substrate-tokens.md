# Substrate Tokens (Native or Asset)

## What are Substrate Tokens?

Substrate tokens are digital assets that exist on blockchain networks built using the Substrate framework. These can be either native tokens of the blockchain (like DOT for Polkadot) or custom assets created on the network.

## When to use Substrate Tokens?

Use Substrate tokens when you want to:

- Engage with communities in the Substrate ecosystem.
- Distribute rewards on networks like Polkadot and its parachains.
- Promote adoption and use of Substrate-based projects.

## How to create Substrate tokens reward?

1. In the campaign creation process, navigate to the 'Rewards' section and select "Substrate Tokens (Native or Asset)" as your reward type. Then, choose between [AirToken](../../../air-token) and [AirPool](../../../air-pool).
