# Whitelist/Shortlist

## What is a whitelist/shortlist?
A "Whitelist/Shortlist" is a manual reward that can be configured to show any image and title that you would like.

## When to use a whitelist/shortlist?
Usually, a whitelist/shortlist reward is used for instances where you cannot use AirLyft to distribute the reward. 

For example:
- You are launching an NFT project and want to capture early community members or supporters.
- The reward is some merchandise that you will manually send to the winners.
- You want to create an event for a beta product access, discount, pre-launch offers etc.

## How to create a whitelist?

1. While creating a campaign, you would be able to see "Whitelist/Shortlist" in the the 'Rewards' section. Make your reward type selection by clicking on the Whitelist/Shortlist button.
