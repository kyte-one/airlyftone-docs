# Pure Random Raffle (Specific Time)

This is an automatic winner selection strategy that means that the winners will be chosen without any intervention from the community host. Community host can also set the time at which the rewards should be distributed.

The pure random strategy works as following:
1. Collect all participants who have scored at least 1 XP **in the particular campaign.**
2. Randomly select winners from the entire participant pool, completely ignoring XP scores.
3. Distribute the reward to users at a specific time decided by the community host.

*Please Note: Unlike Ranked Random Raffle, Pure Random selection does not consider XP scores when selecting winners. All participants who have completed at least one task have an equal chance of winning.*

## Example
- **No. of Participants:** 200 
- **No. of Winners:** 50
- **XP Scoring:** 
    - 20 XP is the max XP that can be scored.
    - 100 Participants scored 20 XP
    - 80 Participants scored 15 XP
    - 20 Participants scored 5 XP
- **Result:** 50 winners will be randomly chosen from all 200 participants, regardless of their XP scores. A participant with 5 XP has the same chance of winning as someone with 20 XP.
