##### Following are the market pain-point we are trying to solve,

In the present blockchain industry, companies are excellent at creating products, but when it comes to marketing and expanding their community, these products fail to obtain the necessary momentum, which causes the growth curve to eventually flatten out significantly. The following are some of the issues:
- Bots or multiple accounts are used by a few users to gain an unfair advantage in contests, which demotivates the real community members from participation.
- It takes hours to design & develop a contest that will captivate participants and teach them about the project at the same time i.e. Learn To Earn campaigns.
- Validating userâ€™s actions on the blockchain, and connecting them with actions on other social media channels is a laborious task.
- Collecting wallet addresses of winners & distributing rewards is a cumbersome activity.
- Once users win a token reward, they usually swap the same with other assets as they are unaware of the token applications.
- Web3 users are scattered across blockchain/ecosystem silos & it is difficult for projects to attract and onboard users active on different chains.
