# Creating ERC721 AirPool

This article focuses on how to create your first ERC 721 reward pool on AirLyft.

There are two ways to create ERC 721 AirPool. You can either create them from the AirPool tab, or you can click on **Create New Pool** while adding a reward to your campaign.

## Create a Pool within campaign

- In order to create AirPool from the Rewards, go to the Rewards tab under your campaign, and choose NFT Giveaway(ERC721) and then choose AirPool Giveaway.

## Create a Pool through AirPools page

- You can also go to the AirPool page where you can find your existing Pools or create a new one. Lets create a new AirPool by clicking on the Create AirPool button available on top right corner of the screen.

- A new window pops up asking you to select the type of AirPool you want to create. Select NFT ERC721 from the list of options.

- You will now be provided with few options to fill about the reward pool that you want to create such as Pool Name, Blockchain, Asset, Token Ids to be locked.

- While filling up the pool details, please do keep your token IDs handy that you want to lock as part of the reward pool and enter in the Token Id block as required. 

- Next, if you don't see your assets available on the list, you can find the [Request Asset Whitelist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmdE3BmNwWQ1kZbKZqFzzRoBX38ltecXiSjuS5VEthwH28Yw/viewform) option. Click on it and fill up the short form for us to manually add the tokens to the asset list. You can contact our support on [support@airlyft.freshdesk.com](mailto:support@airlyft.freshdesk.com) for a faster resolution.

- Once you fill up the pool details, next you will be asked to connect your Metamask, or any EVM supported wallet to sign the transaction, and approve locking of mentioned token ids into the pool.

- Next step is for you to approve the transaction by paying minimal gas fees on the network and let a reward pool be approved for creation at AirLyft. Once you have approved it, you can now see Create option enabled for you to create the reward pool.

- After you click on create, allow some time for the transaction to be included in the block until the transaction is completed.
