- Next, if you don't see your tokens available on the list, you can find the [Request Asset Whitelist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmdE3BmNwWQ1kZbKZqFzzRoBX38ltecXiSjuS5VEthwH28Yw/viewform) option. Click on it and fill up the short form for us to manually add the tokens to the asset list.

- Once you fill up the pool details, next you will be asked to connect your Metamask, or any EVM supported wallet to sign the transaction, and approve locking of mentioned Amount into the pool.

- Next step is for you to approve the transaction by paying minimal gas fees on the network and let a reward pool be approved for creation at AirLyft. Once you have approved it, you can now see Create option enabled for you to create the reward pool.

- After you click on create, allow some time for the transaction to be included in the block until the transaction is completed.
