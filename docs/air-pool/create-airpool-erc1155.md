- Next, if you don't see your tokens available on the list, you can find the [Request Asset Whitelist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmdE3BmNwWQ1kZbKZqFzzRoBX38ltecXiSjuS5VEthwH28Yw/viewform) option. Click on it and fill up the short form for us to manually add the tokens to the asset list. 

- Next step is for you to approve the transaction by paying minimal gas fees on the network and let a reward pool be approved for creation at AirLyft. Once you have approved it, you can now see Create option enabled for you to create the reward pool.

- After you click on create, allow some time for the transaction to be included in the block until the transaction is completed.
