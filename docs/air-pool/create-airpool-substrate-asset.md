# Creating Substrate Native / AssetHub Asset AirPool

This article focuses on how to create your first Substrate Native / AssetHub Asset reward pool on AirLyft.

## What are Substrate Native and AssetHub Asset?

The main difference between a Substrate native asset and an Asset Hub asset lies in their functionality and the way they are handled within the Polkadot ecosystem. Click [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-assets-index) to learn more about them.

### Substrate Native

Substrate is the blockchain framework that Polkadot is built on, and a Substrate native asset would be the primary token of a blockchain built using Substrate. For example, the native cryptocurrency for the Polkadot blockchain is the DOT.

### AssetHub Asset

These are assets that are managed and facilitated by the Asset Hub, a specialized parachain on Polkadot designed for handling and managing digital assets across various applications. Assets in the Asset Hub can be represented on several chains and can take many forms, from a parachain's native token to on-chain representations of off-chain reserves.

## Creating AirPool

There are two ways to create Substrate Native / AssetHub Asset AirPool. You can either create them from the AirPool tab, or you can click on **Create New Pool** while adding a reward to your campaign.

### Create a Pool within campaign

- In order to create AirPool from the Rewards, go to the Rewards tab under your campaign, and choose Substrate Tokens (Native or Asset) and then choose AirPool Giveaway.

Click on it and fill up the short form for us to manually add the blockchain or asset to the list. You can contact our support on [support@airlyft.freshdesk.com](mailto:support@airlyft.freshdesk.com) for a faster resolution.

- After you select your asset, choose the wallet you'd like to use for the transaction. Then click on **Fetch Accounts**. Then select the account you'd like to use, and then click on **Get Balance**.

- After your balance is fetched from the account, enter the amount of amount of tokens you'd like to lock in the pool.

- Then, click on **Deposit & Create**, then sign the transaction and allow some time for the transaction to be included in the block until the transaction is completed.
