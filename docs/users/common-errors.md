# Common Errors

### Telegram: "Bad Request: User Not Found"
AirLyft uses Telegram Bots to verify whether you have joined a group or not. The Bot needs to find you in the group for this task to be completed. If you are facing this issue then try the following to fix it:
1. Make sure you have joined the group and completed any captcha/verification.
2. Make sure that the user you are verifying with, is the same user account that you have used to join the group
3. If you joined the group way before the campaign was created, try leaving and joining the group again, and then verifying the task.

### Could not verify. The same account/IP might have been used for verifying the same quest already.
You can get this error in two main cases:
1. If you are using the same social account or wallet, and have already verified the quest with the same wallet already.
2. If you are using the same IP or device for verifying the quest again with a different user.

Kindly participate with a single user account on all quests, trying to participate with multiple user accounts might also get your accounts blocked.
