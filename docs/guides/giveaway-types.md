Let’s discuss each of these reward types in-depth and when can you use it. 


* **Token Giveaway:** As the name suggests, this is the first type of event which can be used by the projects to distribute rewards directly from AirLyft. We understood that it is a hectic job for marketing individuals or community managers to collect addresses and then distribute rewards manually. Ultimately, the event that was supposed to run for a week takes annoyingly long to complete. To automate the entire efforts, AirLyft has built an event template where you can lock these rewards on chain that you want to distribute and let AirLyft take care of the rest. No more collecting address and distributing rewards manually. Take a step to Lyft Off! 
    
* **Whitelist/Shortlist:** The next template is our very own whitelist template. This is best suited for  all projects who wants to host campaigns where they are looking forward to shortlist users for any specific event be it related to tokens, games, NFT or anything. This template allows you to create an event irrespective of you are launched or not on a blockchain. 

* **Token Whitelist:** Next template on AirLyft is Token Whitelist template that projects can use to select a specific blockchain and then host their events on that particular blockchain. It will allow all the participants to connect their wallet and only then participate in the event being hosted. 

* **NFT Whitelist:** NFT projects are increasing with each growing day and there are tons of whitelist event being done by NFT projects to provide minting allowlist for their users. Using the NFT whitelist template at AirLyft, these processes can be automated saving hundreds of hours for project to collect wallet address of participants completing all the innovative tasks. 

* **NFT Giveaway:** Next template on AirLyft is NFT Giveaway template where projects can use it to lock the NFT rewards for a particular collection or multiple collections on-chain on our smart contract and then distribute NFT rewards directly to the shortisted winners. From each task validation to distribution of NFT rewards, all is taken care of by AirLyft with its NFT giveaway templates.

* **Coupons & Secret Codes:** Coming to the best part, AirLyft also provides its users with the flexibility to distribute specific coupons or secret codes to their shorlisted winners. These coupons or specific code can be say a code which users can use internally in a gamefi project to get specific resources or a referral code for signing up in a particular project or anything. There isn't any limitation to which sort of codes do you want your participants to reward with.
