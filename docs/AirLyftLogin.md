> *If you take a quick look at the very end of the OAUTH page, you can see what exactly does AirLyft collect 
during a Google login which is just Name, Email Address, Profile Picture, and Language Preference that AirLyft can use for your account. Please note that these are all public information that can be shared publically.* 

* Next, is that you can also use login mode as Twitter where you would need to Aurthorize Twitter Application to login to AirLyft. Just click on Sign In with Twitter and then click on Authorize button to move forward with account creation.

> Now, please do take a look at the point stated just below the Authorize button where you can see what data AirLyft collects when you authorize which is just simple READ ONLY public information that includes Seeing Tweets, Twitter Profile Views, Your followed accounts and your email address for login purposes into AirLyft. Please note that we don’t have any access over it and it is used just to fill your public information in AirLyft.



* Lastly, you can also use Metamask to login and create your account at AirLyft. Just click on Sign in with Metamask and then select the wallet address with which you want to login.

> Take a look at what information is accessed by AirLyft while you connect with Metamask. AirLyft only will be able to see address, account balance, activity and suggest transactions to approve. This is the by default access provided by wallet in a 3rd party interaction.
