## Caveats

The AirLyft Widget is currently in Pre-Release mode. Please note the following caveats when using the platform:
1. Currently, PolkadotJS does not work for login or quests. Ask users to use Subwallet or Talisman for Substrate-based actions.
1. Validating Telegram Quests is coming soon; currently, it does not work.
